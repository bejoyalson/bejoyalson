## Bejoy Alson — C# / React / SQL Engineer 👋

I design and build end‑to‑end web applications leveraging ASP.NET Core, React, and relational data platforms (SQL Server + performance-focused schema design). I focus on clean architecture, API ergonomics, and measurable performance.

Core Focus Areas:

ASP.NET Core REST APIs + minimal APIs / controllers
React (Hooks, RTK Query, component composition)
SQL Server: indexing strategy, query tuning, execution plan review
Identity & auth: JWT, OpenID Connect integration
CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, container builds)
Recent Highlights:

Reduced average API response time from 180ms to 55ms by applying caching & index refactors
Migrated monolithic .NET Framework app to modular ASP.NET Core solution with zero downtime
Implemented role-based multi-tenant security model with row-level data filters
Built React + ASP.NET Core real-time dashboard (SignalR) for live operational metrics
What I’m Building / Exploring:

Advanced query analysis automation
Front-end performance budgets with bundle visualization
Automated database migration safety checks
Tech Stack:
C# • ASP.NET Core • EF Core • Dapper • SQL Server • React • TypeScript • Redis • Docker • SignalR • Azure • GitHub Actions
